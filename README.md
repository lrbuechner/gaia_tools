Data manipulation and visualization module for ESA's Gaia Satellite.

This is a small component of a larger library that I have yet to push to git. The other components are for neural network training and other algorithms; all of which lack sufficient commenting. This is being created for a very specific task so I feel the need to make things perfect before making them public. 

Thanks
